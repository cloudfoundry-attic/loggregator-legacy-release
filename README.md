### Loggregator Legacy Release
===============================

This repo is specifically intended to create releases off of the Loggregator
v99.x branch. Use [loggregator release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release)
for normal day to day releases. This is only a thing while [CF Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release)
is still the preferred way to deploy CF.
